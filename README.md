 # ITP405_Final_Project - Angel Flores

### What is the goal of your application?

`The Goal of my application is to Randomize the characters of a game called Smite. It will have the  
option of choosing to randomize all gods or gods by category such as mages, warriors, hunters etc.  
`

### Who is the primary audience?

`
The primary audience for my app are people who play the game Smite such as myself and my friends, and people world-wide.  
This game can easily be made to randomize other characters of other games as well.  
`

### What will the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations be?

`
Create: People will be able to create new gods to add to the list as they are released over time  
Read: There will be a set database with information of Gods (their category) which will be displayed with images  
Update: People will have the ability to update their preferences in search and hold a list of favorites  
Delete: PLayers can delete Gods/Characters that they absolutely do not like.  
`

### What additional feature would you like to build?

`
I want to have players make accounts where they can choose which gods they want to randomize and have to abaility to update and delete   
characters from their list whenever they want.
